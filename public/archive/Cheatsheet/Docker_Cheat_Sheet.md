## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script used to build Docker images. It consists of a series of commands:

### FROM

Description: Specifies the base image used to build the new image.

### RUN

RUN command

Description: Executes a command in the new image's filesystem during the build process.

### CMD

CMD command

Description: Specifies the default command to run when a container is launched from the image.

### WORKDIR

WORKDIR /path/to/directory

Description: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.

### COPY

COPY source destination

Description: Copies files or directories from the host system into the image.

### ADD

ADD source destination

Description: Similar to COPY, but can also extract tarballs or fetch URLs.

### EXPOSE

EXPOSE port

Description: Informs Docker that the container listens on specific network ports at runtime.

### ENV

ENV key=value

Description: Sets environment variables in the image.

### ENTRYPOINT

ENTRYPOINT command

Description: Configures the container to run as an executable.

### ARG

ARG variable_name

### USER

USER username

```bash
docker network rm my_network
```

Description: Removes the 'my_network' network.

Connect a container to a network:

```bash
docker network connect my_network container_name
```

Description: Connects a container to the 'my_network' network.

Disconnect a container from a network:

```bash
docker network disconnect my_network container_name
